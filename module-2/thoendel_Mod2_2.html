    <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Phillip. I grew up in a small town in South Dakota and currently reside in 
       a somewhat larger town in South Dakota. I like that it is inexpensive to live in South Dakota 
       but life here can be kind of "same-zy"</p>
    
       <p>I enjoy playing the guitar. I have a synthwave band and we write songs and play shows. 
     <span class="sentence">We have a big light rig that plays neat flashy things and sets the mood for when we play.</span></p>
     
     <p>I have two cats. Wonton is a very pretty longhaired cat, but she can be a diva and is 
        sometimes not nice to my friends. Rikku is very sweet and loves to play, she makes friends easily.</p>
    
        <p>Life is very busy for me. On top of classes I am also working as a Application Developer intern. I try to 
       "keep my eye on the prize", education has been very good to me and I am grateful for the opportunities it 
       has created for me.</p>

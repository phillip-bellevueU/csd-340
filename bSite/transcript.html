    <h1>Transcript of my Interview with Dave</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Tell us your name</li>
        <p>{d}: No </p>
        <p>{me}: Ok fine, I already know it so I don’t why I asked</p>
        <p>{d}: Me either </p>

        <li>Your dog seems very friendly, what is the dogs name?</li>
        <p>{l}: ***ripper</p>
        <p>{me}: Um…you seriously named your dog that? </p>
        <p>{l}:   No</p>
        <p>{me}: …it looks like her collar says Shelby, is her name Shelby?</p>
        <p>{l}: No (dogs ears perk up)</p>

        <li>What kind of dog she? She reminds me of one of the “dags” from Snatch.</li>
        <p>{l}:  Dunno, rescue just said she was a terrier mix. I think she’s part pit but they don’t tell you that at the shelter.  They are afraid people won’t adopt them if they say they’re pits.   *has affectionate exchange with Shelby*</p>
        <p>{me}: She doesn’t seem aggressive in any way.</p>
        <p>{l}: She’s not, I have never heard her bark. Do you want to give her a treat?</p>
        <p>{me}: Yeah, I’ll give her a treat *gives dog treat, tail wags*</p>
      
        <li>I see your shirt says [company name redacted], do you work there?</li>
        <p>{l}: yessir, I am a material engineer</p>
        <p>{me}: so like…metal and stuff</p>
        <p>{l}: basically, I figure out what things need to be made of, and make sure they are being made to spec.</p>
        <p>{me}: so like, quality assurance?</p>
        <p>{l}: not really</p>

        <li>How did you get into that field?</li>
        <p>{l}: joined the army, went to school on the GI bill after I got out</p>
        <p>{me}: you are a veteran?</p>
        <p>{l}: yessir, a real veteran, combat</p>
        <p>{me}:  wow, sounds intense.</p>
        <p>{l}: it was</p>
        <p>{me}: at least they paid for college?</p>
        <p>{l}: yep, the army gets its pound of flesh though.</p>

        <li>What inspired you to join the army?</li>
        <p>{l}: I was broke, and free college sounded good</p>
        <p>{me}: can you expand on that a little bit?</p>
        <p>{l}: no</p>

        <li>I can’t help but notice it’s January and you have some beautiful looking tomatoes on your counter, where did you get them?</li>
        <p>{l}: I grew them</p>
        <p>{me}: seriously?</p>
        <p>{l}: yep, I built a greenhouse in my basement</p>
        <p>{me}: that’s pretty sweet, can I check it out?</p>
        <p>{l}: sure</p>

        <p>* The basement indeed has an artificial greenhouse. Inside a tent, plants are growing, lights are providing artificial sunlight and heat. Outside the tent, jugs of various liquids line shelves on the wall. *</p>
        
        <p>{l}: It’s mostly lettuce and tomatoes during the winter, in the spring I do potatoes and onions in my garden.</p>
        <p>{me}: this is friggin awesome man…</p>

        <li>What motivates you to do this?  </li>
        <p>{l}: I don’t like relying on the store for my produce.</p>
        <p>{me}: I guess not, this seems like a lot of work, and expensive</p>
        <p>{l}: it is, but it’s cool to see the stuff grow</p>

        <li>How do you keep track of all the tent conditions?</li>
        <p>{l}: I use an app that monitors temperature and humidity, the lights and heat even go down at night to simulate natural conditions.</p>
        <p>{me}: that is seriously cool</p>
        <p>{l}: I know</p>

        <li>Well, this interview has to be 10 questions, and this is number 10. My assignment requirements don’t say who has to ask the questions, so for the last one, do you want to ask me a question?</li>
        <p>{l}: not really</p>
        <p>{me}:  oh come on, there has got to be a question you have for me</p>
        <p>{l}: Have you told your mom you love her today?</p>
        <p>{me}: wow man, really? I guess, no…</p>
        <p>{l}: well you should</p>
